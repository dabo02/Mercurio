janus-gateway-js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cargomedia/janus-gateway-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cargomedia/janus-gateway-js) [![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/cargomedia/janus-gateway-js/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/cargomedia/janus-gateway-js?branch=master)
================

## About
Modern javascript client for [janus gateway](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/). Based on websockets. The original client can be found here https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/rest.html.

## Example of usage

```js
var janus = new Janus.Client('address', {
  token: 'token',
  apisecret: 'apisecret'
});

janus.createConnection('id').then(function(connection) {
  connection.createSession().then(function(session) {
    session.attachPlugin('bla').then(function(plugin) {
      plugin.send({}).then(function(response){});
      plugin.on('message', function(message) {});
      plugin.detach();
    });
  });
});
```

## Build
Project has a customized build. By default `npm run-script build` it builds the single file `janus.js` that contains Janus library and all its dependencies. In order to make the result less in size you have two command line arguments: `--global` and `--external`. The first is to map dependencies to global variables. Usually you want to do this when there is no loader mechanism. The latter is to externalize dependencies to a separate file `vendor.js`. In that case `janus.js` expects to have its dependencies as modules and relies on `require` mechanism.
Here is the couple of examples.
 - Default build. It is used in integration tests.

   ```
   $(npm bin)/gulp
   ```

 - `bluebird` and `webrtc-adapter` are externalized to `vendor.js`

   ```
   $(npm bin)/gulp --external=bluebird --external=webrtc-adapter
   ```
 - `bluebird` and `webrtc-adapter` are expected to be in global namespace under names `Promise` and `adapter` correspondingly.

   ```
   $(npm bin)/gulp --global.bluebird=Promise --global.webrtc-adapter=adapter
   ```

## Tests
Tests are located under `test/` directory. To run them use `npm test`.

### Unit
These tests are located under `test/unit/`. To run them use `$(npm bin)/mocha`.

### Integration
These tests are located under `test/integration/`. To run them you need:
- Have a working instance of Janus server. Put its address to `test/integration/config.json`
- to have a Chrome/Chromium no less than 51 version on the machine where you are going to run tests.
- use `$(npm bin)/karma start test/karma.conf.js` to run tests. Please note that karma should be able to see the necessary version of Chrome.

## Release
 - update package.json with a new version
 - release a new git tag with the updated package.json

After that the npm release should be done automatically. If it didn't happen then release it manually:
```
npm publish https://github.com/cargomedia/janus-gateway-js/archive/<GitTagWithUpdatedPackageJson>.tar.gz
```

## Plugins
Currently the project has four implemented plugins: audiobridge, videostreaming, rtpbroadcast and audioroom. It is temporarily. As soon as the project is stable those plugins will be moved to their own repositories. If you require a plugin that is not implemented then you need to write it on your own.

### How to write a Plugin
For simplicity lets write an [EchoTest plugin](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/janus__echotest_8c.html) that does only `audio`.

```js
  function EchoTest() {
    Janus.MediaPlugin.apply(this, arguments);
  }

  EchoTest.NAME = 'janus.plugin.echotest';
  EchoTest.prototype = Object.create(Janus.MediaPlugin.prototype);
  EchoTest.prototype.constructor = EchoTest;

  Janus.Plugin.register(EchoTest.NAME, EchoTest);

  /**
   * @param {boolean} state
   * @returns {Promise}
   * @fulfilled {RTCSessionDescription} jsep
   */
  EchoTest.prototype.audio = function(state) {
    var self = this;
    return Promise
      .try(function() {
        return self.getUserMedia({audio: true, video: false});
      })
      .then(function(stream) {
        self.createPeerConnection();
        stream.getTracks().forEach(function(track) {
          self.addTrack(track, stream);
        });
      })
      .then(function() {
        return self.createOffer();
      })
      .then(function(jsep) {
        var message = {body: {audio: state}, jsep: jsep};
        return self.sendWithTransaction(message);
      })
      .then(function(response) {
        var jsep = response.get('jsep');
        if (jsep) {
          self.setRemoteSDP(jsep);
          return jsep;
        }
      });
  };
```

Then we can use it
```js
var janus = new Janus.Client(config.url, config);
janus.createConnection('client')
  .then(function(connection) {
    return connection.createSession();
  })
  .then(function(session) {
    return session.attachPlugin(EchoTest.NAME);
  })
  .then(function(echotestPlugin) {
    return echotestPlugin.audio(true);
  })
```
